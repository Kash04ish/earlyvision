# EarlyVision: Hacking cancer detection
This project aims to develop a web application for early detection of visual cancers such as skin. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, the application will analyze visual images of affected areas and user-provided symptom descriptions to predict the likelihood of cancer. Users will input their symptoms through a simple interface, and the application will prompt them with relevant questions to provide additional context. The images and symptom data will then be processed using advanced image processing algorithms to extract meaningful features for analysis. The results will include cancer prediction, comparison with normal images, and differentiation between malignant and benign tumors. This information empowers users to seek appropriate medical consultation promptly, potentially leading to early intervention and improved treatment outcomes. The project involves gathering a large dataset of images containing examples of healthy and diseased conditions, cleaning and preprocessing the images, training machine learning models, and integrating the trained model into a user-friendly web interface. Overall, the project aims to facilitate accurate cancer detection using convolutional neural networks and contribute to early intervention and prevention of visual cancers.
